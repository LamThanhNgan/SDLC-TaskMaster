## SDLC Phases

### 1. Analyze Requirements

In this phase, we analyze and gather the requirements for the ToDo Web App. Key tasks include:

- Conducting user interviews and surveys to understand user needs.
- Documenting functional and non-functional requirements.
- Creating use cases and user stories.
- Defining data models and database requirements.
- Identifying potential third-party integrations.
- Developing test cases.

### 2. Feature Development

The feature development phase includes gathering requirements, designing, implementing, and testing features for the ToDo Web App.

#### 2.1. Gather Requirements

- Collect user requirements through interviews, surveys, and feedback.
- Document user stories and feature specifications.

### 3. Design

In the design phase, we create detailed technical specifications and user interface designs. Key tasks include:

- Developing the system architecture.
- Designing the database schema.
- Creating wireframes and UI mockups.
- Defining system interfaces and APIs.
- Selecting technology stacks and tools.

### 4. Implementation

During the implementation phase, we build the ToDo Web App according to the specifications defined in the design phase. Key tasks include:

- Writing code for the front-end and back-end components.
- Integrating third-party services if necessary.
- Implementing user authentication and authorization.
- Testing individual modules.
- Maintaining version control and documenting code.

### 5. Testing

The testing phase focuses on ensuring that the ToDo Web App functions correctly and meets user requirements. Key tasks include:

- Developing and executing unit tests.
- Conducting integration testing.
- Performing system testing.
- Identifying and fixing bugs and issues.
- Conducting usability testing with real users.
- Ensuring performance and security testing.
