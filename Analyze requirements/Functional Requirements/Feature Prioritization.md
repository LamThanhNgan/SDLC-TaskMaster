# Feature Prioritization

## Introduction

Feature prioritization is essential to ensure the successful development of the ToDo Web App. This document outlines the prioritization of features based on their importance, impact, and alignment with project goals.

## Priority Levels

We use the following priority levels to categorize features:

- **High Priority**: Features critical for the initial release and core functionality.
- **Medium Priority**: Features important but not immediately critical.
- **Low Priority**: Features with lower urgency and potential for later implementation.

## Feature List and Prioritization

### High Priority

1. **User Registration**
   - Enable users to register with a valid email and password.
   - Send confirmation emails upon successful registration.

2. **User Login**
   - Allow registered users to log in securely.
   - Provide password recovery options.

3. **Task Creation and Management**
   - Enable users to create, edit, and delete tasks.
   - Implement task details like title, description, due date, and status.

4. **Task Prioritization**
   - Allow users to assign priority levels (e.g., high, medium, low) to tasks.
   - Implement sorting of tasks by priority.

### Medium Priority

5. **Task Categorization**
   - Enable users to categorize tasks into predefined categories (e.g., work, personal, shopping).
   - Allow users to create custom categories.

6. **Task Completion**
   - Implement the ability for users to mark tasks as completed.
   - Archive completed tasks for later reference.

### Low Priority

7. **User Profile**
   - Create a user profile page displaying user information and statistics.
   - Allow users to update their profile information and change their password.

## Rationale

The prioritization is based on several factors, including:

- **Core Functionality**: High-priority features are essential for basic functionality.
- **User Needs**: Features that directly address user needs and pain points.
- **Project Constraints**: Consideration of time and resource constraints.

## Conclusion

This feature prioritization document serves as a guide for the development team, helping to focus efforts on critical features that align with project objectives. Priorities may evolve during development based on feedback and changing circumstances, but this initial prioritization provides a strong foundation for the ToDo Web App development process.
