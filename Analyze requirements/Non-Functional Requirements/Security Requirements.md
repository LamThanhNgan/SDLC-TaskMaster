# Security Requirements

## Introduction

Security requirements are vital to safeguard the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of the ToDo Web App. These requirements are essential to protect user data and ensure a secure user experience.

## Authentication and Authorization

- **Requirement 1**: Users shall be required to authenticate using a secure and robust authentication mechanism (e.g., password, multi-factor authentication).
- **Requirement 2**: The system shall enforce role-based access control to ensure that users have appropriate permissions for accessing and modifying data.

## Data Encryption

- **Requirement 3**: User data, including login credentials and task details, shall be encrypted during transmission using industry-standard encryption protocols (e.g., TLS/SSL).
- **Requirement 4**: Sensitive data stored in the database (e.g., passwords) shall be stored securely using strong encryption techniques.

## Secure Communication

- **Requirement 5**: The ToDo Web App shall use HTTPS for all communications to protect data transmitted between the client and the server.
- **Requirement 6**: The application shall implement security headers to prevent common web vulnerabilities (e.g., Cross-Site Scripting - XSS, Cross-Site Request Forgery - CSRF).

## Authentication Controls

- **Requirement 7**: Implement account lockout mechanisms to prevent brute force attacks.
- **Requirement 8**: Passwords shall adhere to a strong password policy, including complexity requirements and expiration periods.

## Data Access Controls

- **Requirement 9**: The system shall log and monitor user access and data modifications for auditing and security purposes.
- **Requirement 10**: Access to sensitive user data shall be restricted to authorized personnel only.

## Security Updates and Patching

- **Requirement 11**: Regularly update and patch the application and server infrastructure to address known vulnerabilities.
- **Requirement 12**: Establish a process for promptly addressing security vulnerabilities and applying patches.

## Incident Response

- **Requirement 13**: Develop and maintain an incident response plan to address security incidents, including data breaches and cyberattacks.
- **Requirement 14**: Notify affected users in the event of a data breach and comply with relevant data protection regulations.

## Third-Party Security

- **Requirement 15**: Third-party libraries and components used in the application shall be regularly reviewed for security vulnerabilities, and updates shall be applied promptly.

## Conclusion

These security requirements are crucial to protect user data and maintain the trust of users in the ToDo Web App. Adherence to these requirements should be a top priority throughout the development and operation of the application. Regular security assessments and audits should be conducted to ensure compliance with these requirements and to identify and mitigate potential security risks.
