# Performance Requirements

## Introduction

Performance requirements define the expected performance characteristics of the ToDo Web App. These requirements are essential to ensure that the application meets user expectations and operates efficiently under various conditions.

## Response Time

- **Requirement 1**: The system shall respond to user actions, such as task creation or updates, within 2 seconds.
- **Requirement 2**: The initial page load time for the application shall not exceed 3 seconds on a standard broadband connection.

## Scalability

- **Requirement 3**: The system must support a minimum of 1000 concurrent users without significant performance degradation.
- **Requirement 4**: The application architecture should allow for easy horizontal scalability to accommodate increased user loads in the future.

## Load Handling

- **Requirement 5**: The ToDo Web App should be able to handle a minimum of 500 tasks per user without noticeable performance issues.
- **Requirement 6**: During peak usage times, the system should maintain acceptable performance without service disruptions.

## Resource Utilization

- **Requirement 7**: The application's memory consumption should not exceed 100 MB per user session.
- **Requirement 8**: CPU utilization should remain below 70% on the server under peak load conditions.

## Data Retrieval

- **Requirement 9**: Data retrieval for individual tasks or user profiles should take no longer than 1 second, even with a large number of tasks.

## Error Handling

- **Requirement 10**: The application should provide informative error messages within 5 seconds when errors occur, helping users troubleshoot issues.

## Network Performance

- **Requirement 11**: The ToDo Web App should minimize the amount of data transferred over the network to reduce load times, especially for mobile users.

## Conclusion

These performance requirements are critical for ensuring that the ToDo Web App delivers a responsive and efficient user experience. Meeting these requirements will contribute to user satisfaction and the overall success of the project. It's essential to continuously monitor and optimize performance throughout development and post-launch to ensure adherence to these requirements.
